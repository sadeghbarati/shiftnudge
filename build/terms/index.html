        <p>BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR SERVICES.</p>

(“Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), our mobile applications, and the services, content and materials made available via the Site or mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”). These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Company for products, services or otherwise.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending you an email notification, providing notice through the Services or updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of the Services following our notice of the amended Terms will confirm your acceptance of the amended Terms. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you may not continue accessing or using the Services.</p>

        <h6>4. Terms of Sale</h6>
        <p>Access to certain materials, video and other course content on the Services is made available for purchase (“Premium Services”). Your payment for any access to any Premium Services is subject to the following terms:</p>
        <p>Price; Payment Plans. The price for any Premium Services will be made available via the Services at time of purchase. You may pay for access to the Premium Services in full at the time of your purchase or pursuant to any installment payment plan that we make available.</p>
        <p>Installment Payment Plans. If you select an installment payment plan, you hereby grant Company permission to automatically charge the applicable Premium Services fee to your designated payment method at the beginning of each applicable payment period until all payments have been completed. If you select an installment payment plan, you agree to keep your designated payment method information, including all billing information, current, complete and accurate.</p>
        <p>Valid Payment Methods. Only valid payment methods acceptable to us, or our designated payment processors, may be used to purchase access to our Premium Services. By submitting your order to purchase access to our Premium Services, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use your designated payment method and authorize us, or our designated payment processors, to charge your purchase to that method. If your payment method cannot be verified or is invalid, your order may be suspended or cancelled automatically. You must resolve any problem we, or our designated payment processors, encounter in order to proceed with your order.</p>
        <p>Refunds. Please consult our refund policy at https://shiftnudge.com/refunds/ (“Refund Policy”) for information regarding any refunds that may be available for any Premium Services. To be eligible for a refund, you must make a refund request through our customer service team (<code>matt@mds.is</code>) within the applicable time period set forth in the Refund Policy.</p>
        <p>No Cancellations. Other than in connection with our Refund Policy, all sales are final and we do not offer any refunds or cancellations. If you select an installment payment plan, you will be obligated to complete all installment payments.</p>
        <p>Failure to Pay A failure to pay an installment payment related to any of the Services may result in the immediate suspension or termination of all Services. Upon suspension or termination, you will no longer be able to access your account and any Services. To maintain access to your account and all corresponding Services, your account and payments must be current and in good standing for all programs and Services for which you have registered. Pursuant to our Refund Policy, if your account is suspended or terminated for a failure to pay, you will not receive any refund except at our sole discretion and any scheduled automatic renewals will not occur.</p>
        <p>Errors in Charges. In the event of an error that results in an incorrect charge, we reserve the right to correct such error and revise your order accordingly if necessary (including charging the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any erroneous amount charged. In addition, we may, in lieu of a refund as provided in this paragraph, opt to provide you with a service credit, with a value equal to the amount charged to your payment method.</p>
        <p>Taxes. You are responsible for any applicable sales or use tax, duties, or other governmental taxes or fees payable in connection with your purchase. If you do not pay such sales or other tax or fee on a transaction, you will be responsible for such taxes or fees in the event that they are later determined to be payable on such sale, and Company reserves the right to collect such taxes or other fees from you at any time.</p>
        <p>Automatic Renewal Terms. Certain Services are ongoing subscriptions (“Subscriptions”). By enrolling in a Subscription program, you agree that a Subscription fee will be billed at the price you agreed to when subscribing to the payment you provide for the then-current Subscription period on a recurring basis until you cancel. If you do not wish for your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or cancel your Subscription, please email us at <code>matt@mds.is</code>. You must cancel within 30 days after your Subscription period begins to be eligible for a refund. If you cancel your Subscription within the specified 30 or 60 day period after your subscription period begins, your Subscription will be terminated immediately and you will no longer be able to access the Subscription Services. If you cancel your Subscription after the 30 day period specified above, you may use your Subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term and your Subscription will not be renewed thereafter. You won’t, however, be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current Subscription period.</p>
        <p>Access to Services. Upon payment in full for a program advertised as “lifetime access,” you will receive access to the program that you purchased for the duration of the time Studio MDS operates the Site and your specific program, subject to these Terms. We reserve the right to discontinue programs and adjust the Site and programs at our sole discretion, so, where available, be sure to download any material you want to keep, since you’ll no longer have access to the membership area after access ends. For Subscription programs, you will only receive access to the Services during the term of your subscription, subject to the requirement to be in “good standing” with all other programs set forth in Section 4.f. above.</p>

        <h6>19.1. Binding Arbitration</h6>
        <p>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of Section 11 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Company agree (a) to waive your and Company’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the Services, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive your and Company’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Company agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
        <h6>19.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</h6>
        <p>You and Company agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and Company and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and Company agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Company agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>
        <h6>19.3. Federal Arbitration Act</h6>
        <p>You and Company agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 19 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
        <h6>19.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</h6>
        <p>You and Company agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Company shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Studio MDS, LLC., Attn: Legal, 160 Tracy St. #10 Athens, GA 30606. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Company account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 19, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically.</p>
        <h6>19.5. Process</h6>
        <p>Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 11 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Company agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or Company within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and Company will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute). You and Company agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>
        <h6>19.6. Authority of Arbitrator</h6>
        <p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
        <h6>19.7. Rules of JAMS</h6>
        <p>The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
        <h6>19.8. Severability</h6>
        <p>If any term, clause or provision of this Section 19 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 19 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 19.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>
        <h6>19.9. Opt-Out Right</h6>
        <p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 18 by writing to: Studio MDS, LLC., Attn: Legal, 160 Tracy St. #10 Athens, GA 30606. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 20.</p>
        <h6>20. Governing Law; Forum</h6>
        <p>Any dispute between the parties regarding the subject matter of these Terms will be governed by these Terms and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You and Company agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to any actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property, or relating to these Terms shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Athens-Clarke County, GA (except for small claims disputes, which may be filed in the jurisdiction in which you reside), and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.</p>
