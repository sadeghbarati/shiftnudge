      <div class="sn-mini-faq">
        <h6>Student discount?</h6>
        <p>There are no student discounts for this course. This is pro-level curriculum that you won’t find at univerisities AND it costs a tiny fraction of a university tuition. Considering that, it’s already heavily discounted.</p>

      <div class="sn-mini-faq">
        <h6>Free trial?</h6>
        <p>There is one free video from the course on Design File Organization. This is to give you an idea of the level of quality of the content that you can see for yourself. Other than this video, there is no free trial period for the course.</p>

        <h6>Purchasing power parity?</h6>
        <p>I know $199/mo is a lot in the developing world and there has definitely been lots of interest in the course in those markets. Shift Nudge may offer alternate pricing later on down the road, but for now there is only USD pricing.</p>

        <h6>Refund policy?</h6>
        <p>I’m pleased to offer a 30-day money back guarantee. Try the full course for a whole month and if it’s not for you, I’ll gladly refund you the full amount. I’ll even eat the credit card fees. I’m not happy if you’re not happy.</p>
