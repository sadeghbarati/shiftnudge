  <h4>Rags to riches story about myself</h4>
  <p>Pictue of me biting that hat?</p>
  <p>There is no chin behind Chuck Norris’ beard. There is only another fist. If you spell Chuck Norris in Scrabble, you win. Forever If you ask Chuck Norris what time it is, he always says, “Two seconds ’til.” After you ask, “Two seconds ’til what?” he roundhouse kicks you in the face, Chuck Norris can speak a language inside of another language, A Handicapped parking sign does not signify that this spot is for handicapped people. It is actually in fact a warning, that the spot belongs to Chuck Norris and that you will be handicapped if you park there.</p>
  <p>I went from this to that.</p>
  <p>I went from doing this to now doing this other new thing.</p>
  <p>Clients reached out to me for doing work for them.</p>
  <p>And now I'm going to teach you how to start your own successful business, too — to find an idea, find happy paying customers, all of it.</p>
  <p>I'll show you how to get started, how to build your business up, and even how to make your income streams passive (if that's what you want)</p>
  <p>Not in a scammy, “make a bazillion dollars in your slippers!!” way, but in a realistic way that's step by step, fun, and fits into your life.</p>
