    <h3>What about <em>[insert your own unique situation here]</em>?</h3>
    <p>Here’s the bottom line. If you want to improve your UI skills, then this course will help, period. There’s not really a special situation that would disqualify you from learning and becoming better.</p>
    <p>Chances are if you need to ask a super specific question, it’s possible that you don’t believe it will help and you want me to convince you. If that’s you, then I encourage you to join and see what all the hype is about and if it turn’s out you don’t like it within 30 days, you can get a full refund.</p>

    <p>Shift Nudge will work for brand new designers, veteran designers, busy professionals, international students, men, women, experienced entrepreneurs, first-time beginners, and everything in between, the answer is yes! People from all different types of life situations have had success with the program.</p>
    <p>This course exists for current or future practitioners who want higher-education, design-school level curriculum, without the hefty price tag or time commitment of big universities or expensive bootcamps.</p>
    <p>Especially now that online-learning seems to be the new normal for everyone, I want to provide you the absolute best possible material available on this subject.</p>
    <p>I've taught as a professor of design at the University of Georgia, I've led lots of workshops at conferences all over the country, and I’ve even guest lectured at Harvard, but there's never been enough time to go into ALL of the details of great design. That’s why I created this course. It's everything I know about the visual side of great interface design.</p>
