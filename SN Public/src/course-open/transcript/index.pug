			h1 <a href="javascript:history.back()">&larr;</a> Private Beta Transcript
			
			p Welcome to the Shift Nudge Private Beta. I'm honored that you're here. I want to take this time to give you as much detail as possible about the course and answer any questions you might have.
			
			h2 WHY DOES THIS EXIST?
			p This course exists to build a foundation for each visual design pillar, to get hands on practice, to get experienced feedback on what works and what doesn&apos;t, and more importantly &quot;Why!?&quot;
			p I like to think of this course as &quot;art school in a box&quot; for interface design.
			p This course exists for current or future practitioners who want higher&ndash;education, design&ndash;school level curriculum without the hefty price tag or time commitment of big universities or expensive bootcamps.
			p Especially now that online-learning seems to be the new normal for everyone, I want to provide you the best possible material available on this subject.
			p I&apos;ve taught as a professor of design at the University of Georgia, I&apos;ve led lots of workshops at conferences all over the country, and even guest lectured at Harvard. But, there&apos;s never been quite enough time to go into all of the details of great design. That is why I&apos;ve created this course. It&apos;s everything I know about the visual side of interface design.
			p Finally, this course exists to help you learn the techniques for creating beautiful and functional interface design.
			h2 WHO IS THIS FOR?
			p This course is for anyone who actually wants to get better at creating beautiful interfaces. To be more exact, here are the people who would benefit the most from this course:
			ul
				li Aspiring designers
				li Recent art school graduates
				li Print designers
				li UX designers who have limited visual experience
				li Project managers who want to jump into the creative track
				li Developers who want their visual skills to match their dev skills
				li Struggling UI designers&mdash;or designers who feel stuck and unable to get over that &quot;hump&quot; of what it takes to produce truly great design.
			p And finally, this invitation for enrollment is ONLY meant for those who are in a stable financial situation and can afford to invest in themselves for the future and want to make the most of their time during self-isolation.

			h2 WHO THIS COURSE IS NOT FOR?
			p If you&apos;re on the fence, I&apos;d encourage you not to join. I don&apos;t want to persuade anyone who hasn&apos;t already decided they want to to it.
			p Also, If you&apos;re currently unemployed and in a tight spot, this is not for you right now. This is in no way a tactic to persuade anyone to join a paid course that they are not in a position to benefit from.
			p In the future, I&apos;ll seek out sponsorship opportunities from larger tech companies, but this will require a lot of logistics that I can&apos;t prioritize right now. I am gearing up to produce more design tutorials on my Youtube channel, so feel free to follow along there in the meantime.
			p Someone who is very skeptical. I understand being skeptical, but taking this course will likely not help your skepticism. If you&apos;re not hungry to learn new concepts or re-learn old practices that are rusty for you, then this isn&apos;t going to be fun for you. I&apos;m not looking to convince skeptics here, I want to provide value for those hungry to learn.
			h2 WHAT EXACTLY IS THE COURSE, WHAT DOES IT COVER, WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?
			p I&apos;ve written over 40,000 words preparing for the 80 plus lessons in this course. I&apos;ve consulted with a phD of education, presented my plans at mastermind groups, and have countlessly revised my curriculum in order to produce the absolute best material possible.
			p The course is broken down into 8 modules:
			ul
				li Getting Started
				li Typography
					li Layout
					li Color
					li Style
					li Imagery
					li Elements
					li Tactics
			p Each module contains an average of 10 or so lessons
			p Each lessons contains a video that is around 15-20 minutes in length, as well as supplemental written content.
			p Each lesson is broken down into the following format, Why, What, How, Homework. I want each topic to be extremely clear on why it&apos;s important, have examples of what I&apos;m talking about, and live examples of how to create that particular thing. And perhaps most importantly is the homework that is assigned at the end of each lesson to solidify the principles taught in the video.
			p You will be encouraged to post your homework into the private Shift Nudge slack channel for feedback as well as the occasional nudge to post to your Dribbble profile. If you don&apos;t have an invite, I will personally make sure you get one.
			h2 WHEN WILL THE COURSE BE FULLY COMPLETED?
			p At the time of this writing (and recording the accompanying video) I&apos;ve recorded and published around 70 lesson videos and have another 20 on the way. There is already enough content to to keep you learning for a few months while I produce the remainder of the videos.
			p As a beta student I would absolutely love for you to get started right away and try to watch and complete a minimum of one lesson every other day or so. More if you are willing/able. Your feedback and questions will be absolutely invaluable to me. They will help fine-tune the content and make it the best it can be.
			h2 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
			p There are 80+ lessons in the full course, so at a leisurely pace of 1 lesson per weekday, it would take you roughly 16 weeks to complete. If you were more aggressive and completed 2 lessons per day (and the associated homework) it would take you 8 weeks or so.
			p I wouldn&apos;t recommend going too much faster than that or you risk not soaking in the information.
			h2 OTHER DETAILS?
			p 90% of the time I will be using Figma. 5% of the time I&apos;ll use Sketch. 5% of the time I&apos;ll show examples from Adobe XD, InVision Studio, and even some Framer X.
			p You however, are free to use any design software you&apos;d like. Figma is definitely not a requirement.
			p You are highly encouraged to reach out to me, ask questions, get feedback. Your success is my number one priority. Take advantage of being in the private beta and get as much as you can out of it. I will prompt you often, through the videos, and in the Slack channel, but it&apos;s up to you to put in the effort, ask questions, and anything else that can help propel you forward.
			p I&apos;ll be reviewing your designs weekly and posting personalized feedback videos in the course as well. There are already over 70 student feedback videos available in addition to all of the course content.
			p As a Private Beta student you will have priority support from me, and the ability to shape the direction of future lessons.
			p If you want access to the Private Beta now, but for whatever reason won&apos;t be able to get started immediately, that&apos;s completely fine and totally understandable. I will honor your private beta participation, for however long it takes you to make your way through the course.
			h2 HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
			p The first wave of private beta students paid either a one-time payment of $997 or 6-monthly payments of $199. This included lifetime access to the course, the slack channel, and personalized videos from me critiquing your work along the way.
			p For this second private beta release, I&apos;m honoring the exact same pricing structure.
			p When the course launches publicly, the personalized videos will be a separate plan that will cost twice as much.
			p As a private beta student, you&apos;ll get access to the course and to my personal feedback for a 50% discount.
			p This course and all of my private beta students will be my number one priority for the remainder of the year and I&apos;ll absolutely make sure you are taken care of!
			h2 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER PURCHASE?
			p You&apos;ll receive an order confirmation email, followed by an automated email with your invitation to join the Slack Group.
			p I&apos;m hosting the entire Private Beta course on Notion, so once you&apos;ve enrolled, I will have to manually invite you to the Notion workspace. (Their API hasn&apos;t shipped yet, so I can&apos;t automate this yet.)
			p Once you receive the Notion invite, you&apos;ll need a free Notion account to access the course, if you don&apos;t have one already.
			p As a Notion team member, I will give you the ability to read AND comment on the entire workspace, so any part you want to ask questions about, you can highlight and ask right in place.
			p If you need help with anything, send me an email: <code>matt@mds.is</code> and I&apos;ll take care of you right away.
