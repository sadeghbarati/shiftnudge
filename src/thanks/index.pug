			h1 Thanks for joining!
			
			p Once you're payment is fully processed you'll receive the following emails:

			ul
				li Receipt Email <em>(from SendOwl)</em>
				li Order Email <em>(from SendOwl)</em>
				li Slack Invitation Email <em>(Automated from ConvertKit)</em>
				li Invitation to join Shift Nudge on Notion <em>(Manually from me)</em>

			p Remember, a beta is kind of like a New York City hotel. The view will be nice, but there will be bugs.
			p The SendOwl order email, for example, will have a link that says "access your order here" and it will link you back to this very page. This is not ideal, but a necessary kink while I work out other more important things, like finishing the course. =)

			h2 Support
			p If you did not recieve all of those emails or have any other issues at all please email me <code>matt@mds.is</code> and I will take care of you as fast as humanly possible!
