					p.callout So excited to have you in the course. Watch the video to see what happens next.

					p Once your payment has fully processed, you'll receive the following three emails:

					ol
						li Receipt Email (automatically via SendOwl)
						li Order Email (automatically via SendOwl)
						li Invitation to join Shift Nudge on Notion (manually)

					p The SendOwl order will have a link that says "access your order here" and it will link you back to this very page. This is not ideal, but a necessary kink because I'm using Notion for hosting the course and they don't yet have an API I can tap into to automatically add you.
					p If you already have a Notion account under a different email than you used for purchase, just let me know via email and I will gladly update it for you.

					h4 Support
					p If you did not recieve all of those emails or have any other issues at all please email me <code>matt@mds.is</code> and I will take care of you as fast as humanly possible!
					p Your pal,
					p MDS
