		p.large I've taught as a professor of design at the University of Georgia, I've led lots of workshops at conferences all over the country, and I’ve even guest lectured at Harvard, but there's never been enough time to go into ALL of the details of great design. That’s why I created this course. It's everything I know about the visual side of great interface design.
