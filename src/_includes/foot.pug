				h6 Note from MDS
				p Everything here—words, curriculum, recording, editing, design, code—was produced by my own two fallable human hands. I could've outsourced some of it to make the project go faster, but I wanted to personally showcase my own capabilities by using the exact same techniques that I teach in the course. Thanks for taking the time to check everything out!
