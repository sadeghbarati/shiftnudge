	h2 Start Small
	p With Shift Nudge, you can absolutely start small. You don't have to bite off a massive chunk of design education and choke on it.
	p This course gives you a huge variety of material to learn from. You can do one lesson at a time and let it marinate while you do the homework and apply the principles in your own work.
	h4 Go at your own pace
	p If you're absolutely on fire for knowledge, you can devour the entire course as fast as you want!
	p I do highly recommend doing the homework though, as the assignments for each lesson are carefully crafted to isolate and solidify the core ideas from the lesson.
